# About the project

`TryAtSoftware.Extensions` is a repository containing many libraries with extension methods and utility components one can use to reduce repetitive code or simplify common tasks.

# About us

`Try At Software` is a software development company based in Bulgaria. We are mainly using `dotnet` technologies (`C#`, `ASP.NET Core`, `Entity Framework Core`, etc.) and our main idea is to provide a set of tools that can simplify the majority of work a developer does on a daily basis.

# Structure

This repository contains the source code of two libraries that are part of the `TryAtSoftware.Extensions` suite:
- [`TryAtSoftware.Extensions.Collections`](./TryAtSoftware.Extensions.Collections.md) - a library containing extension methods that should simplify some common operations with collections.
- [`TryAtSoftware.Extensions.Reflection`](./TryAtSoftware.Extensions.Reflection.md) - a library containing extension methods and utility components that should simplify (and optimize) some common operations with reflection.
- [`TryAtSoftware.Extensions.DependencyInjection`](./TryAtSoftware.Extensions.DependencyInjection.md) - a library containing extension methods and utility components that should simplify some common operations with dependency injection.
