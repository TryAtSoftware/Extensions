# About us

`Try At Software` is a software development company based in Bulgaria. We are mainly using `dotnet` technologies (`C#`, `ASP.NET Core`, `Entity Framework Core`, etc.) and our main idea is to provide a set of tools that can simplify the majority of work a developer does on a daily basis.
